# Minifyr 1.0 beta

A PHP script that minify CSS and JS scripts.

You should use it in order to save bandwidth and accelerate load time for your site or web-app.

## How to use

Download this project, copy and paste the "minifyr.php" file into any folder of your project. I strongly 
suggest that you paste it in root directory, this way it becomes easy to refer.

For example:


```

   / (project root directory)
   /minifyr.php

```

Now, everything you have to do is call it in your HTML file:

```

<link type="text/css" media="all" href="minifyr.php?f=path/to/css/file.css" />

```

That's it. Easy and simple. A piece of cake! :)
